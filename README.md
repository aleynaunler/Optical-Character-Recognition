# OpticalCharacterRecognition
OCR system
This project aims to transfer the information on the identity card to the computer environment with OCR. First, identity card divided the region with Template matching as relevant region with efficient region like as name,surname,ID,birh date,document no, valid until.Then that ROI's convert to the gray scale form and then using tesseract every ROI's at the same time every information read from image and transfered to digital.



That working logic is same the scanner.




OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is used to read text from images such as a scanned document or a picture. This technology is used to convert, virtually any kind of images containing written text typed, handwritten or printed into machine-readable text data.




The ID used is completely an example and taken from the internet.




Documents such as passports or any other document in different sizes and characters can be processed in the same way.
